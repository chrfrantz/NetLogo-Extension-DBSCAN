This archive contains the DBSCAN Extension for NetLogo, release 0.3 (28.05.2019). 

Note: The new features of this release (clustering patches - as opposed to just turtles - by variable) are only supported 
for NetLogo versions 6 and higher.

For NetLogo 6.1 onwards, consider using the auto-installation feature (triggered by adding extension header to the model) 
or the Extension Manager. For older versions, copy the folder dbscan (not just the content) into NetLogo's app/extensions folder. 

For more information and detailed installation and usage instructions, refer to
