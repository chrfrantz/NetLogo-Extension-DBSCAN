This archive contains the DBSCAN Extension for NetLogo, v0.3 (30.05.2019). 

Note: The new feature of this release (clustering patches - as opposed to just
turtles - by variable) are only supported for NetLogo versions 6 and higher.

For NetLogo 6.1 onwards, consider using the auto-installation feature 
(triggered by adding extension header 'extensions [ dbscan ]' to the model 
code and saving it) or the Extension Manager. For older versions, create a 
folder 'dbscan' in NetLogo's app/extensions folder and copy the contents of 
this archive into that folder.
