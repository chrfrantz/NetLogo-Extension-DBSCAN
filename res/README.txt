This archive contains the DBSCAN Extension for NetLogo, v0.5 (06.08.2025).

Note that this version (v0.5) is compiled for Netlogo 7. Please find older versions 
in the corresponding git repository branch.

Key features:
- Density-based clustering of turtles and patches by location and variables
- Comprehensive support of NetLogo topologies
- Note that the clustering of patches is only supported for NetLogo versions 
  6 and higher.

For NetLogo 6.1 onwards, consider using the auto-installation feature 
(triggered by adding extension header 'extensions [dbscan]' to the model 
code and saving it) or the Extension Manager. For older versions, create a 
folder 'dbscan' in NetLogo's app/extensions folder and copy the jar files 
contained in this archive into that folder. You can use the provided demo 
model to learn more about the extension.
