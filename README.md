# NetLogo-Extension-DBSCAN
NetLogo extension for DBSCAN clustering algorithm

It allows you to perform unsupervised density-based clustering based on specified turtle variables or proximity. The main advantage over supervised algorithms such as K-Means is that it is not necessary to specify the number of resulting clusters in advance.

## Usage

The extension contains two reporters, `cluster-by-variable` and `cluster-by-location`.

### Clustering by variable

Syntax: `cluster-by-variable` *agents-to-be-clustered* *cluster-variable* *minimum-members* *maximum-distance*

Clusters a given agentset *agents-to-be-clustered* by variable *cluster-variable*, requiring a minimum of *minimum-members* agents to constitute a cluster within a range of variable value difference, with the maximum value difference being *maximum-distance*.

The reporter returns a nested list of clustered agents.

Example:

```
; Import extension
extensions [dbscan]

... instantiate agents with variable "wealth" ...

; Cluster agents by variable "wealth", with at least 3 members to constitute a cluster, and a maximum value difference of 3
let clusters dbscan:cluster-by-variable agents "wealth" 3 3
```

You can then use the cluster information to modify the output, e.g. by colouring and labelling the turtles.

Example (NetLogo 5):

```
; Colour and label the agents by cluster
let ctr 1
(foreach clusters (n-of (length clusters) base-colors)
  [ let aset turtles with [ member? self ?1 ]
    ask aset
      [ set color ?2
        set label (word "ID: " who ", Cluster: " ctr ", Wealth: " wealth) ]
    ; Print agent sets
    output-print (word "Cluster " ctr ": " aset)
    set ctr (ctr + 1) ])
```

The same example in NetLogo 6 (due to syntax changes in NetLogo):

```
; Colour and label the agents by cluster
let ctr 1
(foreach clusters (n-of (length clusters) base-colors)
  [ [ x y ] -> let aset turtles with [ member? self x ]
    ask aset
      [ set color y
        set label (word "ID: " who ", Cluster: " ctr ", Wealth: " wealth) ]
    ; Print agent sets
    output-print (word "Cluster " ctr ": " aset)
    set ctr (ctr + 1) ])
```

### Clustering by location

Syntax: `cluster-by-location` *agents-to-be-clustered* *minimum-members* *maximum-distance*

Clusters a given agentset *agents-to-be-clustered* by proximity, requiring a minimum of *minimum-members* agents to constitute a cluster with a maximum distance *maximum-distance*.

The reporter returns a nested list of clustered agents.

Example:

```
; Import extension
extensions [dbscan]

... instantiate agents with coordinates ...

; Cluster agents by location, with at least 3 members to constitute a cluster, and a maximum distance of 3
let clusters dbscan:cluster-by-location agents 3 3
```

The clusters can then be used as shown in the previous section.

## Demo

For more comprehensive examples for both reporters, try out the demo that corresponds to your NetLogo version.

* For NetLogo 5, use `demo/dbscan-clustering-demo-v5.nlogo`

* For NetLogo 6, use `demo/dbscan-clustering-demo-v6.nlogo`

Clustering agents by location should produce the following output (irrespective of NetLogo version).

## Deployment

### Variant 1: Downloading jar files

To install the extension, download the zip file containing the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/chrfrantz/NetLogo-Extension-DBSCAN/releases) for your NetLogo version (5 or 6). It contains a folder `dbscan` that contains all relevant jar files. Unzip it to the `extensions` folder of your NetLogo installation (the final structure should correspond to `NetLogo x.x.x/app/extensions/dbscan/<jar files>`, with `x.x.x` being the installed NetLogo version).

### Variant 2: Building from source

You can build the extension from scratch using maven after cloning the repository. 

* For NetLogo version 5, run `mvn clean package -f pom-v5.xml`

* For NetLogo version 6, run `mvn clean package -f pom-v6.xml`

In addition, you will need to build the [DBSCAN repository](https://github.com/chrfrantz/DBSCAN.git) (Command: `mvn package`) which contains the underlying DBSCAN algorithm. Place both jar files in the extensions subfolder `dbscan` (following the structure described under Variant 1).
